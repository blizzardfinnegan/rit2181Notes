Week 12 Session 02

Capacitor Transient Analysis - continued 

- Discharge phase
	Continued
  	PSPICE simulation methods/results

- Instantaneous values
 
Reminders 
 
1) Keep reading in chapter 10 for Friday
- Capacitor initial conditions after the quiz

2) Quiz on Friday - Capacitors (Intro and charge)
- Calculate C (cap intro)
- Approximate charge and discharge times, think tau
- Determine time constants, tau
- Find when Vc(t) reaches a specific voltage, tau or instantaneous values
- Find Imax, t=0-, 0, 0+ discussions
