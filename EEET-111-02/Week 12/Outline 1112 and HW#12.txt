Week 12 Session 01

Capacitor Transient Analysis - Charge Phase Continued
 
- Review of the charge circuit equations, including tau
- In class problem 
	Find and sketch ic(t), Vc(t) and Vr(t)
	Find vc(t) and ic(t) at t = 10ms (instantaneous value)
- Multisim demo (of ICP)
	Demo/important simulation steps
	Verification 
- More complicated R-C problem
	Multiple resistors - Approach
	Simulation verification

Homework #12 - Due Monday, 11/26 at the start of class (online class/quiz NEXT Monday 11/19)
 
* Individual:	Chapter 10, problems 29, 37, 40, 44 (Replace the two parallel capacitors with one 20 micro Farad capacitor and use Vc(0)=-4V), 52
 
* Team: 	Chapter 10, problems 26 (use a 50V source instead of 30V), 53, 55
