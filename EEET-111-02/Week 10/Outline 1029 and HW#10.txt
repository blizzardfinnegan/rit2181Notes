Week 10 Session 01
 
Thevenin's Theorem
	- Intro
	- Example
 
ICP	- Find Vth and Rth (multiple source circuit)
	- Finding Vth and Rth via experiment
 
Norton's Theorem
	- Intro
	- Example
 
Homework #10 - Due next Monday, 11/05 at the start of class

Note that problems 9 and 19 are as shown in the text, problems 13 and 14 have been modified from the text (note the parenthesis). 
IA9.2 Means – Instructor Assigned 9.2. For this problem, follow the instructions below to find the Norton Equivalent circuit for 
the two networks called out (Fig 9.140 as is and Fig 9.141 modified with R = 4.7K Ohms).

Individual Assignment, Chapter 9, problem: 9, 13 (find the Norton equivalent instead of the Thevenin equivalent), 14 (replace the 2A current source with a +72V voltage source, + terminal at the top)

Team Assignment, Chapter 9, problem: 19 and
Instructor Assigned 9.2: Find the Norton equivalent circuit for the network external to resistor "R" for the circuits shown in Figure 9.140 AND Figure 9.141 (Use R = 4.7k ohms, not 1200 Ohms for this figure)
