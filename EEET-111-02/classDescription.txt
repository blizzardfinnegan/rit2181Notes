EEET-111-02
DC Circuits
Professor: Shola Olabisi
Semester: 2181 (2018 Fall)
Time Slot: MWF 12-13 (12-1pm)

Professor Olabisi is a good professor for this course. It is not his passion, but he still puts a lot into his work, and ensuring that his students understand the course well.
This course is very math intensive, and Professor Olabisi requires one specific calculator for this course, some Sharp calculator that costs about $10-$15. Please note that this will not be sufficient later on, and you will eventually be required to buy a Ti-Nspire or an HP calculator of a similar strength. These will not be profided by the school, so be prepared to pony up that amount of money.
Some circuit experience is suggested to make the course run easier, but it is not required. As long as you pay attention in lectures, and ask questions, you should be able to keep up well.
