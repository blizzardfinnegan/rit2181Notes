DC Circuits
Professor: Shola Olabisi
Semester: 2181 (2018 Fall)
Time Slot: MWF 12-13 (12-1pm)

Professor Olabisi is a good professor for this course. It is not his passion, but he still puts a lot into his work, and ensuring that his students understand the course well.
This course is very math intensive, and Professor Olabisi requires one specific calculator for this course, some Sharp calculator that costs about $10-$15. Please note that this will not be sufficient later on, and you will eventually be required to buy a Ti-Nspire or an HP calculator of a similar strength. These will not be profided by the school, so be prepared to pony up that amount of money. This, and later courses, will require you to install MultiSim and ModelSim, both of which can be found on the network drives. How to download and install this on your personal computer should be explained in class or by a handed out document. The executable is too large to add to a GitHub repository, and as such we will not be uploading it. Instructions may also be found in other repositiories distributed by this user, but where exactly is left as a test for the end user. (Yes, we just did that; and yes, we know, we're assholes.)
Some circuit experience is suggested to make the course run easier, but it is not required. As long as you pay attention in lectures, and ask questions, you should be able to keep up well.
