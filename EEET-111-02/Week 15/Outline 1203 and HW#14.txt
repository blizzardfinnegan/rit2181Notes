Reminders
----------
1) Homework #13 - Due today at the start of class
- Late assignments will not be accepted

2) Keep reading the inductor sections (11.9 - 11.14) of the text for Wednesday

3) Check your final calculator course grade on myCourses (TODAY)
- This is your unadjusted grade to date
- I will update the gradebook on Tuesday afternoon to reflect:
	Dropping your lowest 2 HWs
	Dropping your lowest 2 Quizzes
	Course Participation

4) Quiz (our last one) - Friday
