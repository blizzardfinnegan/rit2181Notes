The first exam will cover chapters 1 and 2 of Stewart, up to section 2.6.

The expectation is that you would have been practicing throughout the term on the posted problems in the WebAssign system.  But if you've not been doing that, then here are some practice problems out of the book.  You should expect to see problems similar to these.

If you tend to struggle with some type of problem, then I recommend finding videos to watch on YouTube.  This is the primary reason WebAssign is recommended for the class: the video modules are included. 

Exam 1 will be about the following topics.  I have indicated practice problems or the workshop number where appropriate:

    Know the following terms, and be able to state their definitions and give examples: power function, polynomial, rational function, exponential function, amplitude, period, arcsine, arctan, logarithm, inverse function, limit, one-sided limit, pole, removable singularity, continuity
    Know the graphs of the sine, cosine, and tangent, including intercepts.
    Know the relation of the trigonometric functions to the unit circle.
    Be able to graph a function by hand using the rules for manipulating graphs discussed in "1.3: New functions from old": 1.3 1-3,9-24
    Simplifying expressions involving exponential functions and logarithms: 1.4 1-4; 1.5 35-41
    Solve an equation involving exponential functions and logarithms: 1.4 51-54
    Determine if a function is one-to-one by applying the horizontal line test.  Find the equation for an inverse function given the equation of the function f(x) itself.
    Fit an exponential, linear, or quadratic function to data (Lectures, Workshop)
    Determine the local behavior of a rational function near a zero or pole (workshop)
    Find the domain of a rational or algebraic function (1.1: 41-47)
    Find the limit of a rational function at a point (2.2: 31-33, 40, 41; 2.3: 18,23,24,28,31,32, workshop)
    Find the horizontal asymptotes of a rational function (2.6: 15-18, 21, 26, 31, 47-50)
    Determine a limit graphically (2.2: 4-10)
    Compute a limit algebraically using the limit laws (2.3: 1-32, 41-46)
    Find points where a function is continuous (a) given a formula, (b) given a graph (2.5: 3,4,17-24)
    State, in your own words, the definition of "The limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity, is infinity" (discovery module, 2.4)
    State, in your own words, the definition of "The limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity, is L" (discovery module, 2.4)
    State, in your own words, the definition of "The limit of f(x) as x approaches c, is infinity" (discovery module, 2.4)
    Say what continuity means numerically (error analysis: lectures, workshop)
    Be able to state and illustrate the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Squeeze Theorem
    Use the intermediate value theorem to guarantee that an equation has a solution.  (2.5: 53-56)
