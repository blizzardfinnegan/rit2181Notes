Exam 2 will be on Friday, November 2.  It will cover the following sections of Stewart: 2.7, 2.8, 3.1-3.7, 3.9, 3.10, 4.1,4.3.  There will be particular emphasis on the skill of calculating derivatives using the rules for differentiation (Stewart, Chapter 3 Review, p. 267, 1-41.)  Additionally, you should be able to:

    State the difference between dy and dy/dx
    State the definition of the derivative as a limit (2.7-2.8), and calculate it in simple cases.
    Given a collection of plots, be able to match a function with its derivative.
    Be able to compute the differential (or derivative) of any function.  (Chapter 3 review problems 1-50).
    Use differentials to obtain useful approximations.  For example, "Use differentials to estimate the cube root of 8.1 to three decimal places."  (3.10: 23-31,36,39)
    Find the slope of an implicitly-defined curve at a specific point.  (3.5: 5-20)
    Find the equation of the tangent line to an implicitly-defined curve at a specific point.  (3.5: 25-32)
    Given a relation between time-dependent quantities (like 3.9: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,13,14), be able to set up the equations that relate the rates of change of those quantities.  Also, be able to solve for any unknown rates in terms of given rates.
    Given a differentiable  function and a compact interval, be able to find the absolute maximum and minimum values using the table method. (4.1: 47-62)
    Given a differentiable function, find the stationary points and use the table method to classify them as local maxima, local minima, or neither. (4.1: 15-28 -- use "table method", 4.3: 9-18)
