MATH-181-17
Project Based Calculus 1
Professor: Johnathan Holland
Semester: 2181 (2018 Fall)
Time Slot: Unknown

Professor Holland is a rather difficult professor to learn from. He is a very nervous individual, and if someone does not understand a topic correctly, he struggles finding another way to explain the topic. He has a sense of humor, but its not amazing.
This course isn't overly hard for a first year course, and the amount of work needed is reasonable. The only difference between project based Calc1 and regular calc1 is the project. The year we took this course, Professor Holland decided that it should be extra credit. This should not be expected to happen regularly, and we recommend taking the non-project based Calculus route. An understanding of algebra is imperative.
