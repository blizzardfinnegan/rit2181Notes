Professor Foltz is a wonderful professor. He loves in class discussion, and keeps it on topic fairly well. His readings are interesting, and his assignments are very straightforward.
As someone who has a lot of trouble writing, the papers required in this course are very easy to write, and we found the course very enjoyable. We highly recommend this course to all.
